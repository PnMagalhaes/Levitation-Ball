* Library of MOSFET model parameters (for "power" MOSFET devices)
*
* This is a reduced version of OrCAD's power MOSFET model library.
*   You are welcome to make as many copies of it as you find convenient.
*
* The parameters in this model library were derived from the data sheets for
* each part.  Each part was characterized using the Parts option.
* Device can also be characterized without Parts as follows:
*	LEVEL		Set to 3 (short-channel device).
*	TOX		Determined from gate ratings.
*	L, LD, W, WD	Assume L=2u.  Calculate from input capacitance.
*	XJ, NSUB	Assume usual technology.
*	IS, RD, RB	Determined from "source-drain diode forward voltage"
*			specification or curve (Idr vs. Vsd).
*	RS		Determine from Rds(on) specification.
*	RDS		Calculated from Idss specification or curves.
*	VTO, UO, THETA	Determined from "output characteristics" curve family
*			(Ids vs. Vds, stepped Vgs).
*	ETA, VMAX, CBS	Set for null effect.
*	CBD, PB, MJ	Determined from "capacitance vs. Vds" curves.
*	RG		Calculate from rise/fall time specification or curves.
*	CGSO, CGDO	Determined from gate-charge, turn-on/off delay and
*			rise time specifications.
*
* NOTE:	when specifying the instance of a device in your circuit file:
*
*	BE SURE to have the source and bulk nodes connected together, as this
*	is the way the real device is constructed.
*
*	DO NOT include values for L, W, AD, AS, PD, PS, NRD, or NDS.
*	The PSpice default values for these parameters are taken into account
*	in the library model statements.  Of course, you should NOT reset
*	the default values using the .OPTIONS statement, either.
*
* Example use:	M17	15 23 7 7	IRF150

*
* The "power" MOSFET device models benefit from relatively complete specifi-
* cation of static and dynamic characteristics by their manufacturers.  The
* following effects are modeled:
*	- DC transfer curves in forward operation,
*	- gate drive characteristics and switching delay,
*	- "on" resistance,
*	- reverse-mode "body-diode" operation.
*
* The factors not modeled include:
*	- maximum ratings (eg. high-voltage breakdown),
*	- safe operating area (eg. power dissipation),
*	- latch-up,
*	- noise.
*
* For high-current switching applications, we advise that you include
* series inductance elements, for the source and drain, in your circuit file.
* In doing so, voltage spikes due to di/dt will be modeled.  According to the
* 1985 International Rectifier databook, the following case styles have lead
* inductance values of:
*	TO-204 (modified TO-3)	source = 12.5nH		drain = 5.0nH
*	TO-220			source =  7.5nH		drain = 3.5-4.5nH
